Snippets and setup for competitive programming

<> Go to Tools -> Developer -> New Snippet... 
   Copy the snippet, you can edit the tab trigger as per your choice. Save it and you are good to go.
<> cpp_io is the build system I use for competitive programming. It lets me see the output on the screen itself.
   After using this build system, change the layout from the View tab to display an input.in and an output.in file on the right side of the screen.
   
   I will add detailed instructions later.
